## Testing
- <a href = "https://github.com/lucascardone/EDA_Challenge/tree/master/test/test">Go to test packages</a>
- 134 possible cases tested in total
- The three tested classes of implementations have 100% coverage

## Download and specs
<p>The dependencies for the bot to be online are in the <a href = "https://github.com/lucascardone/EDA_Challenge/tree/master/libraries">libraries folder</a>. Once the project is downloaded, these .jar dependencies must be added to the libraries folder within the project in netbeans</p>
<p>Reminder: the version in which the bot was created is netbeans 8.2, it will not work if you try to run it with older versions</p>
